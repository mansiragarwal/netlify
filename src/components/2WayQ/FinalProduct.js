            Current Implementation
            Online learning has made the concept of polling and students raising their hands to ask a question about lecture content harder. Current tools donâ€™t provide an easy enough method to author polls. The mechanism for a student to raise their hand or speak up during class is not the best. 
            Future Additions and Improvements
            Make an easy to author polling system for the lecturer
Make a way for students to ask questions in a similar manner to raising their hand and waiting for their turn without disrupting the lecture
